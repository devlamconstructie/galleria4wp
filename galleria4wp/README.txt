Replaces default wordpress galleries with a Galleria.js lightbox gallery or caroussel. 
Works with shortcodes (' [gallery /] ') and with Gutenberg Gallery blocks.

== Description ==

The plugin retrieves the the most up-to-date galleria.js (currently version 1.6.1. ) and the chosen theme from a cdn.
The plugin also adds an options page where you can select the galleria theme of choice (default: Azur), enter css to override default theme settings 
and a custom download adress if you wish to use your own custom themes.

Galleria For Wordpress  is heavily indebted to Andy Whalen's Galleria plugin. It is also, however, a complete re-write in order to comply with the current Wordpress coding best practices. 

== How to Use == 

`[gallery ids="5,4,6,7"]`

== Installation ==

1. Upload Galleria to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place the [gallery] shortcode in your pages or posts.
